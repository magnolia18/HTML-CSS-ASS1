        <p>
          Nothing is more important to us on Earth than the Sun. Without the Sun's heat and light, the Earth would be a lifeless ball of ice-coated rock.
          The Sun warms our seas, stirs our atmosphere, generates our weather patterns, and gives energy to the growing green plants that provide the food and oxygen for life on Earth.

        <h2>Nothing Without Water</h2>
        <p>We know how important water is to human life and also, because of agriculture, how important it is to plant life. 
           But what about the earth in general? How important is water to the ecological balance of the earth? What role does it play and what would happen if we were to lose it or it didn't exist?

        <h2>Air is mostly gas</h2>
        <p>
            Air is all around us, but we can’t see it. So what is air, exactly? It’s a mixture of different gases. The air in Earth’s atmosphere is made up of approximately 78 percent nitrogen and 21 percent oxygen.
            Air also has small amounts of lots of other gases, too, such as carbon dioxide, neon, and hydrogen.
